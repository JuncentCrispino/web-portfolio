        Experienced Civil Engineer Turned Web Developer
      </h4>
      <p>
        Greetings! I am an ambitious and skilled professional who brings
        together a diverse range of experiences in civil engineering and web
        development. With over three years of hands-on experience as a civil
        engineer, I made a successful transition into the world of web
        development and have been utilizing my skills to create innovative and
        efficient solutions. Here&apos;s a brief overview of my journey and the
        technologies I use:

        Civil Engineering Background
      </h4>
      <p>
        As a civil engineer, I honed my problem-solving abilities and attention
        to detail through various infrastructure projects. I gained valuable
        experience in project management, structural design, and construction
        supervision. These experiences have cultivated my ability to approach
        challenges with a systematic and analytical mindset.

        Web Development Expertise
      </h4>
      <p>
        Driven by my passion for web development, I transitioned into this
        exciting field to pursue new opportunities. I specialize in building
        robust and scalable web applications using Node.js and NestJS for
        backend development. I am well-versed in designing and managing
        databases using MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas and MySQL, ensuring efficient
        data storage and retrieval.
        <br />
        For the frontend, I leverage the power of Next.js and React.js to create
        dynamic and responsive user interfaces. To enhance the user experience,
        I utilize Tailwind CSS, Material UI, and CSS to create visually
        appealing and intuitive designs.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4 className="text-base font-semibold md:text-lg">AWS Proficiency</h4>
      <p>
        With expertise in managing and deploying applications on AWS, I leverage
        the cloud computing services to ensure optimal performance and
        scalability. I have experience working with AWS EC2 instances, utilizing
        Nginx as the web server to handle high-traffic loads.
        <br />
        Additionally, I have developed serverless applications using AWS Lambda,
        API Gateway, S3, SQS, SES, SNS, CloudFront and CloudWatch Events to
        optimize serverless computing and streamline task automation. I have
        also implemented CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous
        Deployment) practices using AWS CodeDeploy, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild
        to ensure efficient and automated deployment of applications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My journey from civil engineering to web development has equipped me
        with a unique perspective and a diverse skill set. I am passionate about
        creating high-quality web applications and solving complex problems.
        With a meticulous approach and proficiency in a wide array of
        technologies, I am committed to delivering exceptional results and
        driving innovation in the ever-evolving field of web development.
